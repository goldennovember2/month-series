# Rainbow Undecimber - CLI in Go

This project was inspired by:
* **Big Data Systems** course from HPI
* **Distributed Systems** course from MIT
* **Powerful Command-Line Applications in Go** by Ricardo Gerardi. 


> The name of the repository, **Rainbow Undecimber**, and the name of 12 functions, are inspired by the webtoon series Tower of God. 
In Tower of God, the 13 Month Series consists of an inventory (Rainbow Undecimber) and 12 weapons, each named after a month.
