# Thirteen month series CLI written in Go

Each month starting from January 2023, I will try to research and add one function to the CLI. 

> The name of 13 functions are inspired by the webtoon series Tower of God. 
In Tower of God, the 13 Month Series consists of an inventory (Rainbow Undecimber) and 12 weapons, each named after a month.

## List of functions


This project was inspired by:
* **Big Data Systems** course from HPI
* **Distributed Systems** course from MIT
* **Powerful Command-Line Applications in Go** by Ricardo Gerardi.
